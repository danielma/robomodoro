# Robomodoro

Don't sit at your desk all day.

This is a simple implementation of the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)

It runs in the menu bar, it doesn't take a bunch of resources, and it might help you not sit at your desk all day.

Notification

I like to make my notifications `alerts` instead of `banners` so that they stay around until I acknowledge them.
